# Processors-on-Verilog
## Description
To build a 5-stage pipelined processor capable of executing any one array sorting algorithm other than the bubble sort. Basically, you will be converting your single cycle processor to a pipelined one. Normally the instructions you have already implemented should enable you to execute a sorting algorithm program with small additions i.e., you might need to implement the bgt or blt instruction, or something similar, so that you know when youâ€™d need to sdap two values. This would require small modifications to the circuit.
## Routes
- `Single Cycle Processor` contains the modules for single cycle implementation of the RISC-V processor.
- `Pipelined Processor` contains the modules for pipelined 5-stages implementation of the RISC-V processor.
- `Hazard Controlled Pipelined Processor` contains the modules for pipelined 5-stages with forwarding and stall logic implementation of the RISC-V processor.
- `sorting_algorithm`contains the selection sort algorithm converted to Assembly language for RISC-V architectrue and machine language code for the instruction memory of the processor.
